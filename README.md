## Database (Supabase)

All tables use Row Level Security (RLS). Every policy is scoped to the authenticated user via `auth.uid() = user_id`.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | Stores user first name and email, auto-created on signup via a database trigger |
| `bible_reading` | Logs individual reading sessions |
| `prayer_log` | Prayer requests and answered status |
| `journal` | Journal entries |
| `goals` | Goal cards with Kanban status |
| `fitness` | Workout sessions with type and duration |
| `verses` | Verse pool for the daily verse feature |

---

## Authentication

Auth is handled entirely by Supabase. Sessions are managed via cookies using `@supabase/ssr`. A middleware file (`proxy.ts`) redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` for all protected routes.

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed on **Vercel**. Environment variables are configured in the Vercel project settings. Cron jobs for the daily and weekly emails are defined in `vercel.json` and hit the `/api/send-daily` and `/api/send-weekly` routes with a `CRON_SECRET` bearer token for security.
